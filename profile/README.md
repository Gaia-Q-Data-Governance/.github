('110', 'Complete Interchangeability', 'With Inspection', 'Interchangeable after inspection', 'Conventional', 'Use for parts that require visual or dimensional inspection before substitution'),
-- Additional conventional codes...

-- Example insertions for quantum ICY codes
INSERT INTO ICY_CODE_DEFINITION (code, category, subcategory, description, domain, application_guidelines)
VALUES 
('700', 'Quantum-Classical Interchangeability', 'General', 'Quantum component can replace classical component', 'Quantum', 'Use for quantum components with classical interfaces'),

## 9. Indexes and Performance Considerations

### 9.1 Additional Indexes

In addition to the indexes defined in the table creation scripts, the following indexes should be added to optimize common query patterns:

```sql
-- Indexes for common queries
CREATE INDEX idx_part_domain ON PART(domain);
CREATE INDEX idx_part_technology_category ON PART(technology_category);
CREATE INDEX idx_icy_code_domain ON ICY_CODE_DEFINITION(domain);
CREATE INDEX idx_assignment_effective_date ON ICY_CODE_ASSIGNMENT(effective_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_assignment_expiration_date ON ICY_CODE_ASSIGNMENT(expiration_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_implementation_requirement_type ON IMPLEMENTATION_REQUIREMENT(requirement_type);
CREATE INDEX idx_verification_requirement_type ON VERIFICATION_REQUIREMENT(verification_type);
```

### 9.2 Partitioning Strategy

For large deployments, consider partitioning the following tables:

```sql
-- Partition ICY_CODE_ASSIGNMENT by domain
ALTER TABLE ICY_CODE_ASSIGNMENT
PARTITION BY LIST (
    (SELECT domain FROM PART WHERE part_id = original_part_id)
) (
    PARTITION p_conventional VALUES IN ('Conventional'),
    PARTITION p_quantum VALUES IN ('Quantum'),
    PARTITION p_sustainable VALUES IN ('Sustainable')
);

-- Partition AUDIT_LOG by year and month
ALTER TABLE AUDIT_LOG
PARTITION BY RANGE (YEAR(action_timestamp) * 100 + MONTH(action_timestamp)) (
    PARTITION p_history VALUES LESS THAN (202501),
    PARTITION p_202501 VALUES LESS THAN (202502),
    PARTITION p_202502 VALUES LESS THAN (202503),
    -- Additional partitions as needed
    PARTITION p_future VALUES LESS THAN MAXVALUE
);
```

### 9.3 Query Optimization

For complex queries, consider creating materialized views that are refreshed periodically:

```sql
-- Create materialized view for interchangeability report
CREATE TABLE MV_INTERCHANGEABILITY_REPORT (
    original_part_number VARCHAR(100),
    original_part_name VARCHAR(255),
    original_domain VARCHAR(50),
    replacement_part_number VARCHAR(100),
    replacement_part_name VARCHAR(255),
    replacement_domain VARCHAR(50),
    icy_code VARCHAR(10),
    icy_code_description TEXT,
    specific_conditions TEXT,
    implementation_count INT,
    verification_count INT,
    approval_status VARCHAR(50),
    last_updated DATETIME,
    INDEX idx_original_part (original_part_number),
    INDEX idx_replacement_part (replacement_part_number),
    INDEX idx_domains (original_domain, replacement_domain)
);

-- Procedure to refresh materialized view
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE sp_refresh_mv_interchangeability_report()
BEGIN
    TRUNCATE TABLE MV_INTERCHANGEABILITY_REPORT;
    
    INSERT INTO MV_INTERCHANGEABILITY_REPORT
    SELECT 
        op.part_number AS original_part_number,
        op.part_name AS original_part_name,
        op.domain AS original_domain,
        rp.part_number AS replacement_part_number,
        rp.part_name AS replacement_part_name,
        rp.domain AS replacement_domain,
        icd.code AS icy_code,
        icd.description AS icy_code_description,
        ica.specific_conditions,
        COUNT(DISTINCT ir.requirement_id) AS implementation_count,
        COUNT(DISTINCT vr.requirement_id) AS verification_count,
        ica.assignment_status,
        ica.updated_at AS last_updated
    FROM 
        ICY_CODE_ASSIGNMENT ica
    JOIN 
        PART op ON ica.original_part_id = op.part_id
    JOIN 
        PART rp ON ica.replacement_part_id = rp.part_id

        ica.is_active = TRUE
    GROUP BY 
        ica.assignment_id, op.part_number, op.part_name, op.domain, 
        rp.part_number, rp.part_name, rp.domain, 
        icd.code, icd.description, ica.specific_conditions, 
        ica.assignment_status, ica.updated_at;
END //

DELIMITER ;

-- Schedule regular refresh
CREATE EVENT evt_refresh_mv_interchangeability_report
ON SCHEDULE EVERY 1 DAY
DO
    CALL sp_refresh_mv_interchangeability_report();
```

## 10. Security Considerations

### 10.1 Role-Based Access Control

The database should be accessed through role-based permissions:

```sql
-- Create database roles
CREATE ROLE 'icy_admin', 'icy_engineer', 'icy_approver', 'icy_viewer';

-- Grant permissions to roles
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON icy_code_db.* TO 'icy_admin';

GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON icy_code_db.ICY_CODE_ASSIGNMENT TO 'icy_engineer';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON icy_code_db.IMPLEMENTATION_REQUIREMENT TO 'icy_engineer';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON icy_code_db.VERIFICATION_REQUIREMENT TO 'icy_engineer';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON icy_code_db.DOCUMENT_REFERENCE TO 'icy_engineer';
GRANT SELECT ON icy_code_db.* TO 'icy_engineer';

GRANT SELECT ON icy_code_db.* TO 'icy_approver';
GRANT SELECT, UPDATE ON icy_code_db.APPROVAL TO 'icy_approver';

GRANT SELECT ON icy_code_db.* TO 'icy_viewer';
```

### 10.2 Data Encryption

Sensitive data should be encrypted:

```sql
-- Enable encryption for sensitive columns
ALTER TABLE ICY_CODE_ASSIGNMENT
MODIFY COLUMN rationale TEXT ENCRYPTED;

ALTER TABLE APPROVAL
MODIFY COLUMN comments TEXT ENCRYPTED;
```

### 10.3 Audit Trail

The AUDIT_LOG table provides a comprehensive audit trail of all changes to the database. Ensure that this table is regularly backed up and that its contents are never modified or deleted.

## 11. Integration Considerations

### 11.1 API Integration

The database schema is designed to be accessed through a RESTful API. Key endpoints would include:

- `/api/icy-codes` - Get all ICY code definitions
- `/api/parts` - Get all parts
- `/api/assignments` - Get all ICY code assignments
- `/api/assignments/{id}` - Get a specific assignment
- `/api/assignments/{id}/requirements` - Get requirements for an assignment
- `/api/assignments/{id}/approvals` - Get approvals for an assignment


### 11.2 Integration with Existing Systems

The database can be integrated with:

1. **Parts Management System**: To synchronize part information
2. **Configuration Management System**: To track configuration changes
3. **Maintenance Management System**: To provide interchangeability information for maintenance operations
4. **Document Management System**: To link to relevant technical documentation


### 11.3 Data Import/Export

Procedures for importing and exporting data should be implemented:

```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE sp_export_icy_assignments(
    IN p_domain VARCHAR(50),
    IN p_status VARCHAR(50)
)

    SELECT

        ica.specific_conditions,
        ica.limitations,
        ica.rationale,
        ica.assignment_status,
        ica.effective_date,
        ica.expiration_date

        ICY_CODE_ASSIGNMENT ica
    JOIN

### ICY Code System - SQL Files and API Implementation

**GenAI Proposal Status: This document is an AI-generated implementation for the ICY Code System and should be reviewed by domain experts before deployment.**

I'll provide the SQL files and API implementation for the ICY Code System. These components will work together to create a robust, production-ready system.

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a comprehensive solution for the ICY Code System, including:

1. **Database Views**: For efficient data access and reporting
2. **Stored Procedures**: For encapsulating complex business logic
3. **Triggers**: For maintaining data integrity and audit trails
4. **Initial Data**: For populating the system with sample data
5. **API Implementation**: For providing a RESTful interface to the system


The system is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and secure, with features such as:

- User authentication and authorization
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Notification system
- Reporting capabilities
- Transaction management
- Error handling


The API follows RESTful principles and provides endpoints for all major entities in the system, including parts, ICY codes, assignments, approvals, and reports.
