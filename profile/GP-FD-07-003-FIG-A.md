# Technology-to-Impact Relationship Diagrams

> **DISCLAIMER: GenAI Proposal Status**  
> This document was generated with assistance from artificial intelligence and represents a proposed structure for the GAIA AIR AMPEL360XWLRGA COAFI documentation system. It should be reviewed by subject matter experts before implementation in any operational context.

## 1. Introduction

This document provides **visual representations** of the key relationships between technologies, systems, operational practices, and environmental impacts within the **GA-SToP-CO2** framework. These relationship diagrams serve as critical tools for:

- Understanding **complex interdependencies**  
- Identifying **optimization opportunities**  
- Supporting **decision-making** across the aerospace value chain  

Using standardized notation and systems engineering principles, these diagrams ensure clarity, consistency, and actionability. They are designed as **living documents** that evolve as technologies mature and new relationships emerge.

### 1.1 Purpose and Scope

This document:
- **Visualizes** causal relationships between technologies and CO₂ emissions  
- **Maps** dependencies between different technological systems  
- **Identifies** critical pathways for decarbonization  
- **Highlights** potential synergies and trade-offs  
- **Supports** cross-domain optimization

## 7. Implementation Guidance

### 7.1 Using the Relationship Diagrams

1. **Identify Critical Pathways**
   Trace relationships to find the most effective routes to decarbonization.

2. **Analyze Dependencies**
   Highlight the enabling infrastructure, policies, or R\&D required for each technology.

3. **Assess Trade-offs**
   Weigh potential conflicts (e.g., weight vs. efficiency) or synergies (e.g., electrification + hydrogen).

4. **Support Decision-Making**
   Provide a visual context to guide technology investments, policy development, and operational strategies.

5. **Communicate Complexity**
   Present complex interconnections in an accessible format for diverse stakeholders.

### 7.2 Integration with Metrics

Each diagram aligns with the standardized metrics defined in **\[GP-FD-07-002-SPEC-A]**, ensuring both **qualitative (diagram-based)** and **quantitative (metric-based)** assessment. Key integration points include:

* **Metric Placement**: Where in the diagram a given metric applies (e.g., CO₂ intensity in a propulsion diagram).
* **Impact Quantification**: Diagrams show qualitative cause-and-effect; metrics provide the numerical evaluation.
* **System Boundaries**: Diagram nodes align with the system boundaries in metrics calculations.
* **Data Flow**: Can trace how data are collected for metrics and aggregated into final reports.

### 7.3 Updating Procedures

1. **Regular Review**
   Conduct quarterly reviews to align diagrams with new technologies or policy changes.

2. **Technology Updates**
   Incorporate emergent propulsion systems, fuels, or operational practices.

3. **Metric Alignment**
   Keep diagrams consistent with revised metrics from **\[GP-FD-07-002-SPEC-A]**.

4. **Stakeholder Input**
   Integrate feedback from domain experts and front-line implementers.

5. **Version Control**
   Log all edits and keep a comprehensive change history.
