# AMPEL360 BWB-Q100 – Certification Strategy, Quantum Readiness Assessment & GA-SToP-CO2 Consolidated Framework

This master document outlines the AMPEL360 BWB-Q100’s integrated approach to certification, regulatory compliance, quantum readiness, and sustainability, with the full GA-SToP-CO2 consolidated framework. It covers quantum technology integration, advanced monitoring, digital twin frameworks, NATO Part Number (NPN) SOP, and sustainability/criticality metrics for audit and operational deployment.

---

## Executive Summary

The AMPEL360 program builds on proven technologies with evolutionary enhancements, prioritizing safety, certification readiness, and quantum-integration preparedness. This includes compliance with CS-25, phased EASA certification strategy, AI-assisted validation, and direct alignment with the GA-SToP-CO2 sustainability and resource criticality framework.
