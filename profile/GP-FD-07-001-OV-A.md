> **DISCLAIMER: GenAI Proposal Status**  
> This document was generated with assistance from artificial intelligence and represents a consolidated structure for the GAIA AIR AMPEL360XWLRGA COAFI documentation system. It synthesizes information from multiple GASToP-CO2 specifications and plans (GP-FD-07-002, GP-FD-07-003, GP-FD-07-004, GP-FD-07-006, GP-FD-07-007). It should be reviewed by subject matter experts before implementation in any operational context. For full details on specific topics, please refer to the individual source documents.

# GA-SToP-CO2 Consolidated Documentation  
## Overview, Core Specifications, Implementation, and Domain Applications

---

## 1. Overview and Foundational Principles

The GA-SToP-CO2 (General Air and Space Technical Ontology Participation on Common Objectives for CO₂ Reduction) framework provides a standardized, lifecycle-based approach for the aerospace sector to measure, manage, and reduce environmental impact, focusing on CO₂ emissions and resource criticality.

### 1.1 Purpose

To enable consistent, accurate, and comparable accounting and reduction of CO₂ emissions and resource impacts within the global aerospace sector through unified metrics, methodologies, visualization tools, and implementation plans.

### 1.2 Vision

A collaborative aerospace ecosystem where sustainability is integral to design, manufacturing, operations, and end-of-life, driving significant CO₂ reductions and resource resilience.

### 1.3 Strategic Objectives

1. **Standardization** – Industry-wide metrics and reporting  
2. **Integration** – Embedding in design, ops, decision chains  
3. **Collaboration** – Partnerships and cross-sector engagement  
4. **Innovation** – Accelerated low-carbon and efficient solutions  
5. **Transparency** – Audit-ready, verifiable reporting

### 1.4 Scope

- Air and space operations, all lifecycle phases  
- CO₂ and other GHG (as CO₂e)  
- Resource criticality: scarcity, supply risk, circularity
