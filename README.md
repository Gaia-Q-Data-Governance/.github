## Technology-to-Impact Relationship Diagrams

This document provides **visual representations** of the key relationships between technologies, systems, operational practices, and environmental impacts within the **GA-SToP-CO2** framework. These relationship diagrams serve as critical tools for:

- Understanding **complex interdependencies**  
- Identifying **optimization opportunities**  
- Supporting **decision-making** across the aerospace value chain  

Using standardized notation and systems engineering principles, these diagrams ensure clarity, consistency, and actionability. They are designed as **living documents** that evolve as technologies mature and new relationships emerge.
