# Technology-to-Impact Relationship Diagrams

> **DISCLAIMER: GenAI Proposal Status**  
> This document was generated with assistance from artificial intelligence and represents a proposed structure for the GAIA AIR AMPEL360XWLRGA COAFI documentation system. It should be reviewed by subject matter experts before implementation in any operational context.

## 1. Introduction

This document provides **visual representations** of the key relationships between technologies, systems, operational practices, and environmental impacts within the **GA-SToP-CO2** framework. These relationship diagrams serve as critical tools for:

- Understanding **complex interdependencies**  
- Identifying **optimization opportunities**  
- Supporting **decision-making** across the aerospace value chain  

Using standardized notation and systems engineering principles, these diagrams ensure clarity, consistency, and actionability. They are designed as **living documents** that evolve as technologies mature and new relationships emerge.

### 1.1 Purpose and Scope

This document:
- **Visualizes** causal relationships between technologies and CO₂ emissions  
- **Maps** dependencies between different technological systems  
- **Identifies** critical pathways for decarbonization  
- **Highlights** potential synergies and trade-offs  
- **Supports** cross-domain optimization
